## How to install

1. Extract the downloaded ZIP file. Find the contained folder named `system-uicons.sdIconPack`.
2. Move `system-uicons.sdIconPack` into the `IconPacks/` directory in your local SD data folder.✱
3. Quit the Stream Deck software and restart it.
4. The icon pack should now be available in your Stream Deck Icon Library.

✱) On macOS, that's `$HOME/Library/Application Support/com.elgato.StreamDeck/IconPacks`,
on Windows it's probably `C:\Users\you\AppData\Roaming\Elgato\StreamDeck\IconPacks`.

## Why

I like clean, "readable" icons, preferrably on a black background. I'm over 40,
maybe there's a relation, what do I know. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
