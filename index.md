# Stream Deck iconpack: System UIcons

This is a free iconpack for the [Elgato Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/en/stream-deck),
based on the clear and concise [System UIcons](https://systemuicons.com/) by
[Corey Ginnivan](https://corey.ginnivan.net/). Thanks, Corey!

The pack consists of 420 monochrome icons. 23 icons come with red/green
alternatives.

The resulting icons are 144Ã—144 PNG files.

## How to install

Download the latest release (a ZIP file), extract it to the `IconPacks/`
directory in your local SD data folder. (On macOS, that's
`$HOME/Library/Application Support/com.elgato.StreamDeck/IconPacks`.) Quit
the Stream Deck software and restart it.

The iconpack should now be available in your Stream Deck Icon Library.

## Why

I like clean, "readable" icons, preferrably on a black background. I'm over 40,
maybe there's a relation, what do I know.
