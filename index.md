## How to install

Download the latest release (a ZIP file), extract it to the `IconPacks/`
directory in your local SD data folder. (On macOS, that's
`$HOME/Library/Application Support/com.elgato.StreamDeck/IconPacks`, on Windows
it's probably `C:\Users\you\AppData\Roaming\Elgato\StreamDeck\IconPacks`). Quit
the Stream Deck software and restart it.

The iconpack should now be available in your Stream Deck Icon Library.

## Why

I like clean, "readable" icons, preferrably on a black background. I'm over 40,
maybe there's a relation, what do I know. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
