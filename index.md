## How to install

Extract the ZIP file to the `IconPacks/` directory in your local SD data folder. (On
macOS, that's `$HOME/Library/Application Support/com.elgato.StreamDeck/IconPacks`,
on Windows it's probably `C:\Users\you\AppData\Roaming\Elgato\StreamDeck\IconPacks`).
Quit the Stream Deck software and restart it.

The icon pack should now be available in your Stream Deck Icon Library.

## Why

I like clean, "readable" icons, preferrably on a black background. I'm over 40,
maybe there's a relation, what do I know. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
